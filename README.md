Drones controller backend service , this is backend application provides rest webservices APIs
to define drones and control it to move medications from stock to customers , simply if we will
provide mobile app or web app to integrate with this backend application end users will be
able to register drones to system , send order to registered drones to load shipment of medication
and send it to customer's GPS coordination. system take care about check ability of drone to
hold medication depends on weight limit of drone and weight of medication also check drone's
battery capacity before start trip to move shipment.

System developed based on Springboot
consist of services are :

- Drone service :
  manage drone data serial number , limit weight , model and battery capacity. retrieve drones
  data check available drones to start trips also you can charge drone from this service.

- Cron service:
  there's a one cron job run every one min (configurable) to get all data about drones batteries capacity and save them
  as a historical data.

- Medication service :
  manage medications data and their weights.

- Order service :
  manage orders of drones create an order for a drone to load a medication , get order history
  hint :- after creating order there's a simulation function starts in thread mode to calculate distance between
  stock GPS coordination (configurable) to customer GPS coordination in KM then after
  drone start its trip the battery capacity of it will be decreased by 2 % per 1 km
  which changes also the state of drone starting from IDLE -> IN_PROGRESS -> DELIVERED.
